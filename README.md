ViewingList is a community for film fans to discover films, construct lists, and interact with others that share their love of film. Keeping track of movies I've seen or want to see is a problem I'm constantly running into so I decided to build an app that would allow me to keep track of that information easily.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Devise, Bootstraps, HTTParty

To install and run locally:
 * Clone this repo
 * Do a Bundle install
 * Do a rails db:migrate

 Unsolved Problems:   Most issues in the current build of ViewingList are style related. I had much bigger plans for the visual aspects of this app but had a lot of trouble getting Bootstraps to cooperate. In the future my plans to improve this sight would be to take Bootstraps out and bring Materialize in.   

 Future Features:
 * Cast and Crew Listings
 * Ability To See All Films Cast and Crew Worked on
 * Genre Sorting
 * Comment Notification System
 * Comments on Comments
 * Build Up Own DataBase
